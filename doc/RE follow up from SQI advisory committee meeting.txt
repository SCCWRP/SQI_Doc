Hi Marcus
Attached is a version of the draft manuscript with SWRBC comments and suggested edits. These are 
mostly from me and a few from Ali, nobody else provided comments.

Some of the comments are summarized below, if this helps
General comments on the SQI:

-	For those less familiar with watershed science, it may be helpful to include a watershed process 
and function conceptual model or model of a healthy stream ecosystem to illustrate key 
linkages between chemistry, physical habitat and biology.  
-	Page 2, Line 45: suggest re-wording to state “Despite varying spatial scales and complexities 
Whether monitoring programs are large and complex or small and straightforward, all 
monitoring programs share the challenge of how to effectively communicate physical, chemical, 
and biological data in a scientifically rigorous…”
o	We can have small and complex too, or conversely, large and simple. 
-	Why is ‘lines of evidence’ used as a blanket term to describe conditions assessment, indicators, 
etc.? This term is specific to Water Board’s Integrated Assessment program. Suggest either 
clearly defining the term up front, or replacing with something less integrated report-centric. 
For example, ‘condition assessment’ or simply removing the term (depending on context). 
-	On page 1, Lines 17-18 stated that the physical parameters include two indices that describe in-
stream (substrate) and stream corridor (riparian) conditions.  Page 3, Lines 86-87 the general 
approach is then described as being based on biology and in-stream. Shouldn’t it also include 
stream corridor/riparian? 
Also on the tool (and I believe these were all brought up at the meeting)-
-if stream name could somehow be added to the pop-up along with the id number, at least in those 
cases where it exists
-make the date, or dates of data collection accessible somewhere, and especially if the tool gets to the 
point where there might be multiple sample collections so trends might be seen
-have the data set accessible, somehow, either through the app directly so if I pull up a sight I can access 
all the background data, or with a link to the database (but I want the data filtered for the site(s) I’m 
interested in ??
-	Thank you for developing a model and tool that highlights biology’s role as a direct measure of 
stream condition. This work provides a strong communication tool and resource to highlight the 
importance of biological data when assessing water quality conditions.  

Thanks to you both for all the work on this tool, it has been interesting to watch its development 
through the whole process.

Good morning, 

Just a friendly reminder that we are anticipating comments from you all today on our SQI draft 
manuscript.  I’ve already spoken with some of you, but please let me know if you are not able to get 
comments back by the end of the day.  

Also, please remember to fill out the Doodle poll for our follow-up webinar:

Thanks,
Marcus

Subject: follow up from SQI advisory committee meeting

Hi everyone, 

Thanks to all of you for participating yesterday in our advisory panel meeting for the SQI.  We had a 
productive discussion and we all agreed that we can move forward on the technical products.

Our next step is to present our final products to the SMC steering committee in June.  In prep for this 
meeting, we have a few action items from yesterday that we need to address.  

-	Please return any final comments on the manuscript to me by Wednesday 4/10.  Emailed word 
documents with track changes are fine.  
-	Email any comments/questions to me about the website 
(https://sccwrp.shinyapps.io/SQI_Shiny) by Wednesday 4/10.  I have a list of suggestions from 
yesterday that I will address in the next few weeks, so anything in addition to what was 
discussed yesterday is welcome. 
-	Email or call me if there are any case studies you wish to discuss that we can include in the 
manuscript.  As a reminder, we are looking for specific examples of how the SQI can help 
support management.  I have suggestions from yesterday and will reach out personally to those 
of you that provided them.  

Finally, we agreed that a final webinar in May would be appropriate to discuss any changes to the 
products prior to the steering committee meeting in June.  Please fill out the Doodle Poll for availability 
in May: https://doodle.com/poll/bvrs972cc4a84y5z

Thanks, 

Marcus
