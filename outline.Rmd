# Introduction

* State of the science for biological assessment
     * Biological indicators are common response endpoints 
     * Multiple taxa can be used - macroinverts, fish, algae, etc.
     * Can trigger 303d listing
     * Many states use more than one index, questions regarding how to combine multiple response endpoints - empirically (average, separate) and in regulatory setting (one fails triggers listing, etc.)

* Biological response is a symptom not a cause
     * Biological impairments require remediation
     * Can be achieved through causal assessments to identify stressors impacting biology
     * Causal assessments are effective but labor-intensive, may require new data
     * Rapid screening tools that combine multiple lines of evidence are useful alternatives to prioritize
     * Additional challenges summmarizing complex data that describe environment, biological response

* Methods to integrate biological, chemical, and physical data are needed
     * Should leverage existing data/indices to inform causal assessments, 
     * Should aggregate multiple biological indicators
     * Should do so to inform management priorities - actionable results in an accessible format
     * To date, no other studies on holistic stream health indices - currently limited to MMI (integrated index) or functional-based measures (e.g., ecosystem metabolism), i.e., how can multiple indices be simultaneously evaluated?

* The Stream Quality Index
     * This paper presents the SQI as a management tool to jointly evaluate stream quality using biological, chemical, physical data
     * The objective of the SQI is to combine multiple indices to provide actionable information that categorically describes stream quality
     * Goals - provide tiers of information (landscape to in situ), diagnostic information for prioritization
     * Uses biology as an endpoint - empirically links biology to chemical, physical stressors
     
# Methods

* Backround on study region, SMC program and data collected
* CSCI, ASCI as endpoints - background on both
* Physical, chemical data as stressors - types of data (eutro indicators, conductivity, PHAB, CRAM)
* Modelling approach - what is the probability of biology being impacted given observed stressors
     * Rf models to predict sites as "good"/"bad" biology as a function of chemistry, physical habitat
     * How was biology combined? BCG bins for both indicators, assigned categories based on combination of bins
     * Models produced pChem, pHab for each site, combined to overall pStress
* Model output to SQI scores
     * Defined categories based on good/bad biology, likelihood of stress (need to emphasize how breakpoints chosen)
     * Overall, Biological condition, Stress condition, Stress condition detail

* Online application 
     * How to use SQI in practice
     
# Results

* SMC breakdown, % by catogory, watershed, etc.
* Most common stressors, should link to land use/watershed position, other covariates
* Interesting trends or sites as examples (e.g., ASCI impacted, chemistry stress vs. CSCI impacted, habitat stress)
* Odd-ball categories - Healthy and resilient, Impacted by unknown stress

# Discussion

* Value of the approach
    * Combines multiple lines of evidence to rapidly evaluate stream health
    * Actionable outcomes
    * Linked to common stressors (eutro, conductivity, physical habitat)
    * First to use RF models to combine multiple indices
    * Broad categories to site-level information provided by index, easily accessible with online app

* Drawbacks/limitations
    * Other stressors not evaluated - flow mod, contaminants, climate change
    * Other biota not considered - fish, amphibians, etc.
    * Some expert judgment for breakpoints or index combos (i.e., average BCG between indices, worse BCG, etc.), but note these were at least partically vetted through advisory committees
    * Policy needs not fully integrated because policy has yet to be cleary defined, though in progress
    * Currently does not consider flow regime (ephemeral, perennial)
    * Cursory - not as comprehensive as full-blown causal assessment but could be used to inform where its needed
  
* Next steps
    * Expansion of toolbox - greater spatial resolution, additional endpoints/stressors
    * Integration with other tools - SCAPE, RSCA, hydromod
